Erik Sorenson – Final Project

This 4 hour lesson plan will consist of (3) 80 Minute Lessons.  The material is aimed at a small group (6-10 Ss).  The ultimate aim will be for the Ss to produce a resume and an interview role-play.  Each lesson will focus on different aspects of creating a resume to build to this.

Lesson 1
Level of Ss: Intermediate
Type of Lesson: Speaking Skill integrating listening, writing and vocabulary.
Aims: 
•	To develop speaking through authentic discussion opportunities.
•	To give Ss the chance to practice the use of descriptive terms (adjectives) in speaking, listening and writing.
•	To integrate listening, speaking and writing skills 
•	To promote creativity through the use of writing and speaking. 

Time: 80 Minutes
Assumptions: Ss should know:
•	Basic descriptive terms for skills (Responsible, Creative, Hardworking, Talented.)
•	Be familiar with vocabulary concerning basic business positions (marketing, management, etc.)
Anticipated Problems:
•	Ss may have difficulty generating more than basic level adjectives when asked to.  In order to aid Ss when this situation arises, Ss will work in pairs and groups.
•	Ss may have difficulty using the target language accurately.  To aid Ss when this situation arises, language structures will be provided in order to help scaffold learning and create opportunities for authentic language to be practiced accurately and with guidance required.

Presentation
Aims:	•	Speaking Skill – Descriptive terms from Ss’ preexisting vocabulary.
•	Listening/Vocabulary – introduce key descriptive terms through discussion.
•	Reading/Vocabulary - introduce descriptive key terms through a sample resume.
•	Ss will be able to rely on past knowledge creating a more comfortable learning situation.

•	To allow Ss the opportunity to hear others in the class using similar information accurately.
Interactive Pattern:	T-S; S-T: S-S (Pair Work); S-T
Time	35 minutes
Aids:	•	White Board/Chalk Board
•	Graphic Organizer - “Ideal Hire - Completed Sample Resume”
•	Graphic Organizer – “Ideal Hire - Skills Context Vocabulary”
Procedure
Step 1 (5 Mins): 
The T will first ask the Ss to think about four descriptive words to describe themselves.  Each S should write down their list.  
The T will then need to elicit responses from the Ss.
Among other terms, the Ss should provide some key vocabulary or the T should add:
•	Responsible
•	Creative
•	Hardworking
•	Talented
The T needs to write these on the board as the Ss list their answers.
Step 2 (10 Mins):
After the list has been created on the board, the T should ask for the definition of the term “skills” from the Ss to make sure everyone in the class has a chance to hear and understand the definition.  As the Ss offer their definitions, the T should create a class definition on the board to help Ss that may have trouble understanding the meaning.  The T should then ask for the Ss to come up with different skills to describe themselves at work.  The T should write these skills next to the descriptive words as they are listed by the Ss.
•	Responsible: Reliable, Dependable 
•	Creative: Innovative, Imaginative 
•	Hardworking: Productive, Efficient 
•	Talented: Versatile, Adaptable

Step 3 (10 Mins):
The T should then have the class come to a definition for the term “resume.”  As the Ss provide their definitions, the T should create a class definition on the board.  After the Ss demonstrate a strong understanding of the concept, the T should introduce the following sample resume through PPT or the GO handout – “Ideal Hire - Completed Sample Resume”:
  
The T should explain the major areas of a Resume:
•	The Header
•	The Objective
•	Educational Experience
•	Work Experience 
•	Skills
The T will explain that today’s focus will be on “Skills.”  The T should now distribute the GO - “Ideal Hire - Skills Context Vocabulary” that focuses on the “Skills” portion of a resume:
 

Step 4 (10 Mins):
The Ss will work together in pairs to understand the descriptive words used and to choose the correct meanings for the highlighted terms Exceptional & Enthusiastic.  Afterwards, the T will ask for volunteers to share their ideas on the meaning of the highlighted words Exceptional and Enthusiastic

Practice
Aims:	•	 Writing – pushing Ss to use their background knowledge and newly learned terms to create a “Skills” section of a resume.
•	Speaking – challenging Ss to analyze the meaning behind the verses/lyrics they are studying.
•	Listening –the Ss will be challenged to listen for new descriptive terms they have learned and apply them analytically.
Interactive Pattern:	T-S; S; SSS (Pair Work); S-T
Time	25 Minutes
Aids:	•	Graphic Organizer – “Ideal Hire - Skills section - Fill-in” 
Procedure
Step 1 (5 Mins):
The T will explain to the Ss that they will now need to work in pairs to create a skills section for an ideal hire at their company (the type of job can be tailored to the class – i.e. Human Resources, Marketing, etc.).  The T will hand out the GO – “Ideal Hire - Skills section - Fill-in.”
 
Step 2 (10 Mins):
Ss will work together to create 5 different declarative sentences explaining the fictitious applicant’s skills.  The pairs should imagine that this potential hire is very well qualified and thus has skills well-suited for a position at their company.  They should use the vocabulary from this lesson in conjunction with their preexisting vocabulary to do this.
Step 3 (5 Mins):
The Ss will next present the “Skills” sections of their resumes to the class.  Following each presentation, the T should push for a little extra information about why the Ss chose those particular skills.   The T should also have the audience take notes on the different skills presented by each pair for use in ranking later.  
Step 4 (5 Mins):
Following all presentations, the class can take a vote on which applicant would be the best hire for the company based on their skills.

Production
Aims:	•	Integrated Speaking and Writing – Ss need to create a personal “Skills” section for themselves and present this to the class.
•	Listening – Ss will need to listen for new vocabulary and prepare related questions based on these terms.
Interactive Pattern:	SSS; S-T/S
Time	20 Minutes
Aids:	•	Graphic Organizer – “My Resume - Skills Section - Fill-in” 
Procedure
Step 1 (5 Mins):
Ss should be broken into groups of four.  In these groups, the Ss will need to create a new list of skills/descriptions for themselves and others in the group.  Each person within the group will need at least 5 different skills or positive descriptions for themselves.  Ss do not need to write sentence, merely the skills/descriptions they are thinking of (i.e. – hardworking).
 Step 2 (5 Mins):
Upon completing Step 1, the T should hand out a new GO – “My Resume - Skills Section - Fill-in” to each S in class.  In their groups they need to work to complete the “Skills” section of the resumes for each person by creating sentences from the skills they thought of in Step 1.    
 
Step 3 (10 Mins):
The Ss will now be asked to share their skills sections with the class through a presentation.  Each S will share the different skills/descriptions that they created for themselves.  All Ss in the audience need to take notes and prepare at least 1 question for the team related to the skills/descriptions presented.
•	i.e. – “How have you been dependable in the past?”
The Ss presenting should attempt to add an example demonstrating the skills if possible.
 
Lesson 2
Level of Ss: Intermediate
Type of Lesson: Grammar: past simple tense.  Function: Expressing previous experience. / Listening Skill integrating speaking, writing and vocabulary. 
Aims: 
•	To develop speaking through discussion opportunities.
•	Past simple tense method of expressing past experiences in the affirmative form.
•	Provide Ss with semi-controlled/free speaking practice discuss previous experiences.
•	To allow Ss to practice the development of their listening for overall ideas and specific details.

Time: 80 Minutes
Assumptions: Ss should know:
•	How to conjugate into the past simple tense.

Anticipated Problems:
•	Ss may have difficulty understanding the technical vocabulary of Steve Jobs’ resume.  To remedy this, the T has rewritten his history to use more common terminology.  The Ss are also allowed to work in groups.  
•	Ss may have difficulty listening for specific terms from a passage.  The T will play the song twice for each Activity (4 times total) and allow Ss to discuss their answers in pairs following the listening exercise before the T reviews the answers with the class.

Aids:
•	Board
•	Podcast on podomatic.com of Steve Jobs’ Resume
•	Day 2 PPT
•	Graphic Organizer – “Steve Jobs Resume - Fill-In”
•	Graphic Organizer – “Ideal Hire - Work Experience Fill-in”
•	Graphic Organizer – “Ideal Hire – Educational Experience – Fill-in”
•	Graphic Organizer – “My Resume - Work & educational Experience Fill-in handout”
•	Graphic Organizer – “My Resume - Standard Template Handout - Fill-in aid”

Criteria for choice and use of materials:
•	I chose to develop my own materials for these lessons in order to create something that would be flexible.  The activities can be adjusted for different position within a company, ultimately personalizing the learning more for the Ss.
•	I wanted to use a podcast as part of this lesson in order to give Ss an opportunity to revisits the listening material after class if they so choose.   
 
•	I chose to use Steve Jobs as a way to engage with the interest level of the Ss.  He is an iconic figure who appeals to the younger generation in this new, technological age.


Review
Aims:	•	Speaking Skill – To review the descriptive vocabulary learned in the previous lesson.
Interactive Pattern:	T-S; S-T
Time	5 minutes
Aids:	•	None

The T should give an oral quiz to the Ss in class, based on the words learned in the previous lesson in order to check their comprehension.  The key terms to focus on are:
•	Responsible: Reliable, Dependable 
•	Creative: Innovative, Imaginative 
•	Hardworking: Productive, Efficient 
•	Talented: Versatile, Adaptable

Presentation
Aims:	•	Speaking/Grammar Skill – Descriptive terms from Ss’ preexisting vocabulary and from those learned in the previous lesson used in the past simple tense.
•	Writing/Speaking – Ss need to create and describe different actions using the past simple and pre-existing/newly learned terms.
Interactive Pattern:	T-S; S-T; 
Time	15 minutes
Aids:	•	Board

Procedure
Step 1 (5 Mins): 
The T first asks the class to think of actions that they completed at work the previous day.  As the Ss orally share their activities, the T should write them on the board in past simple declarative sentences.  As the exercise progresses, the Ss should begin to phrase their activities to follow this sort of pattern when they offer them to the T.
Step 2 (10 Mins):
The T should next challenge the Ss to create a list of responsibilities that they had while they were Ss at University.  Each S should think of and write down 3 different duties that they had while attending University.  The Ss need to be sure to write these declarative sentences using the past simple tense.
Once the Ss have finished writing their sentences, the T should challenge each S to share one of their responsibilities by writing it on the board.  Following each sharing, the T should provide the Ss with feedback correcting any grammar or vocabulary errors.

Practice
Aims:	•	Introduction to work related experience verbs.
•	Target Vocabulary – introduce new work-related verbs for use in description of past experiences.
•	Reading/Vocabulary – reinforce new terms/grammatical principals through a sample “Educational/Work History” section of a resume.
•	Listening – pushing Ss to integrate their understanding of the skills terms and experience vocabulary relationship into an exercise while challenging the S to listen for main ideas and details 
•	Writing/Speaking – Ss will be encouraged to create and describe the “Ideal Hire’s” working and educational background using the grammar and terms they are learning.
•	Speaking – Ss will be challenged to demonstrate an understanding of the listening by sharing their answers.
•	Writing – Ss will apply new terms and pre-existing terms to describe past events in the simple past tense.
Interactive Pattern:	T-S; S-S (par); S-S (Pair Work); S-T; S-S (Pair Work); S-T;  T-S;  
Time	50 Minutes
Aids:	•	White Board
•	Graphic Organizer – “Work Experience – Verbs” 
•	Day 2 PPT
•	Podcast from podomatic.com – “Steve Jobs Resume”
•	Graphic Organizer – “Steve Jobs Resume - Fill-In”
•	Graphic Organizer – “Ideal Hire - Work Experience Fill-in”
•	Graphic Organizer – “Ideal Hire – Educational Experience – Fill-in”

Procedure 1
Part A
Step 1 (5 Min)
The T will distribute the GO – “Work Experience Verbs” to the Ss.  In pairs they must attempt to match the verbs and their definitions.
 
Note: The definitions above were sourced from http://www.learnersdictionary.com/
Once all pairs have completed the GO, the pairs will share their answers and discuss as a class.
Part B
Step 1 (10 Mins):
The T next needs to explain to the Ss that they will listen to a podcast (http://eriksorenson43.podomatic.com/entry/2014-04-27T21_22_18-07_00) of CEO Steve Jobs’ fictional resume.  The Ss will be responsible for listening to the work history section of his resume and deciding the type of job each position was.  Prior to the listening the T should write the following options on the board:
1.	Worked to develop a start-up tech company
2.	Advanced a software company 
3.	Created a media company
4.	Helped an older company create a range of new products
The Ss need to assign one of each of these job descriptions to the correct positions listed on the resume. [Answer Key - Apple Computer Inc. (1980s) =1, NeXT Software Inc. = 2, Pixar Animation Studios = 3, Apple Computer Inc. (2000s) = 4].  
The T should then play the reading of the resume for the Ss twice.  Following the second playing, the Ss should check their answers with their neighbor.  The T will then discuss the correct answers. 
  Step 2 (5 Mins):
The T will next explain that the Ss will be listening again to the reading of the resume, but this time they will be listening for past simple verbs and descriptive adjectives within the resume.  The T should hand out the GO – “Steve Jobs Resume - Fill-In” to the Ss:
 
*Note: Steve Jobs information was sourced from Wikipedia.com
Step 3 (10 Min):
After listening twice more to the reading, the Ss should join their partner once again to compare their answers.  Following this, the class will come together as a group with volunteers supplying each answer and the T either approving or correcting these answers.
Procedure 2
Part A
Step 1 (15 Mins):
The T should next hand out the following GO – “Ideal Hire - Work Experience Fill-in.”
 

Ss will be broken into teams of two to complete this GO.  Ss need to work together to create a “Work History” section that explains what things an ideal hire for their company/position would have done at their previous employment.  This “ideal” hire should be for a position at the company that the Ss are familiar with/currently hold (i.e. – Human Resources, Marketing, Management, etc.).  The pairs should imagine that this potential hire is very well qualified and thus has experience that is well-suited for a position at their company.  The exercise can be tailored to fit the employment backgrounds of the Ss.
Step 2 (5 Mins):
Ss will share the “Ideal Hire’s” fictional work experiences that they created with the class.  The T should provide feedback correcting any past simple grammatical errors.  Following each presentation, the T should push for a little extra information about why the Ss chose those particular skills.   The T should also have the audience take notes on the different skills presented by each pair.  Following all presentation, the class can take a vote on which version would be the best hire for the company.
Step 3 (5 Mins):
The T will now expand on the concept of the “Ideal Hire” and ask the Ss to help fill in the hire’s “Educational Experience.”  To do this, the T needs to use the slide from the PowerPoint titled “Ideal Hire – Educational Experience – Fill-in.”  The T needs to elicit information from the class to fill in the blanks.

 Production
Aims:	•	Witting –Ss need to integrate the structure/vocabulary they have been listening/reading into their writing to create their own personal resume.
•	Integrated Speaking and Listening – Ss need to interview each other and respond using the information from their personal resumes.
•	Speaking – pushing Ss to share the resumes they have created.

Time	40 minutes
Aids:	•	PPT Day 3
•	Graphic Organizer -  “My Resume - Fill-in handout”
•	Graphic Organizers - “My resume role-play cards”

Procedure 1 – Building Personal Resumes
Step 1 (15 Mins):
Ss will now have the opportunity to use the information that they have been gathering over the past two lessons to create their own resumes.  The T should hand out the GO – Resume Template and have Ss work individually to create their very own resumes using their personal information.  The Ss have all of the information that they need for this project; they just need to organize it.  The T should walk the room and offer assistance to any Ss that may need it.
   	 
Step 2 (10 Mins):
Once the Ss have created their resumes they should form pairs and exchange resumes.  They need to check their partners resume for the following 3 pieces of information:
1.	Any grammatical/spelling errors they spot.
2.	Any areas where more exciting vocabulary can be used.
3.	Any areas where a clearer description of information can be given.
The Ss should then decide whether to use these suggestions to edit their resumes.  

Procedure 2 – Real Life Role Play
The Ss will now run through the same Role-Play format, but this time they will use their own information.  For this exercise, the T will act as the Interviewer and the Ss will be interviewing for a position at their current company.  
Step 1 (10 Mins):
The T should distribute the GO and the Ss should organize their information in the same manner as they did for the Ideal Hire Role-Play.  They need to fill out the following GO- “My resume role-play cards” with their own information.  
Student Role Card – You are going to be acting out an interview as yourself with a Manager at the company.  Fill in the following information to organize your answers to the interview questions.  Remember to use the new vocabulary you have learned for the “Skills” section as well as the simple past tense to describe your “Work History.”

Step 2 (15 Mins):
The Ss will now take turns acting out the interview Role-Play with the T.  The audience should keep track of each person’s answers and try to come to a decision of who should be hired for the position once the interviews are completed.
Homework
Tonight, Ss need to use the information that they wrote on the GO – 
http://eriksorenson43.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/my-resume-homework/ 
Students should refer to the GO – “My Resume – Standard Template Handout – Fill-in” for assistance.
